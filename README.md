# BVT Coding Challenge: Roman Numeral Converter and Magic Square of Squares
Submission for BVT's Roman Numeral Converter/Magic Square of Squares Coding Challenge on 14 June 2023. First task was to create logic to take a roman numeral and convert it to an integer and vice versa. Second was to create logic to generate a 3x3 matrix that was as close to a magic square of squares as possible.

**Roman_Numeral_Converter.md** and **Magic_Square_of_Squares.md** detail the expected functionality given to us for each task.
